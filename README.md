# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: data-dynamo-dashboard 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: i want you to create an app like this : "Real-Time Data Analysis and Visualization Tool
Project Description
Develop a web application that allows users to upload datasets and perform real-time statistical analysis and data visualization. The tool should provide various mathematical and statistical functions, interactive visualizations, and dynamic updates based on user inputs.

Key Features
Data Upload and Parsing

Allow users to upload CSV files.
Parse and display the data in a tabular format.
Statistical Analysis Tools

Provide functionalities like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, correlation coefficients, and regression analysis.
Implement mathematical libraries in JavaScript to handle these calculations.
Data Visualization

Use libraries like D3.js or Plotly.js to create interactive visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, line charts, and box plots.
Allow users to customize the visualizations (e.g., select data columns, adjust scales, apply filters).
Real-Time Updates

Implement dynamic updates so that any change in the dataset or parameters immediately reflects in the visualizations and statistical outputs.
Use React state management to handle these updates efficiently.
User Interface

Design a clean and intuitive user interface with a dashboard layout.
Include controls for selecting statistical functions, customizing visualizations, and viewing analysis results.
Interactive Features

Enable zooming, panning, and tooltip functionalities in visualizations.
Allow users to highlight data points or ranges to see detailed information."
